 story.1.desc.phile:1 "The [Root.GetName] is abuzz with news of the alien organisms discovered some time ago.\n\nThese little evolutionary marvels kindle in the [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] people a renewed hope of first contact with intelligent beings."
 story.1.desc.spiri:1 "The [Root.GetName] is abuzz with news of the alien organisms discovered some time ago.\n\n[Root.GetSpeciesAdj] theologians have been partaking in arcane rites since this first sign that divine providence extends outside of [Root.Capital.GetName], attempting to find new answers."
 story.1.desc.gesta:0 "We have confirmed the existence of lower forms of organic life outside of [Root.Capital.GetName]'s biosphere."
 story.1.desc.term:1 "Alien microbes of an organic nature have been detected. Models for the probability of organic alien sapients have been adjusted accordingly. If they exist, they will be found. They will be exterminated."

 story.2.desc:1 "The [Root.GetName] is abuzz with news of the alien organisms encountered some time ago.\n\nSeemingly native to deep space, they make the extremophile creatures of [Root.Capital.GetName] appear frail by comparison."
 story.2.desc.phile:1 "The [Root.GetName] is abuzz with news of the alien organisms encountered some time ago.\n\nSeemingly native to deep space, they make the extremophile creatures of [Root.Capital.GetName] appear frail by comparison. While some doubted, encountering alien life was ultimately expected and anticipated - but nothing could have prepared expectant [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] xeno-biologists for the fascinatingly extreme conditions in which this life thrives."
 story.2.desc.followup:1 "The subjects of the [Root.GetName] receive the report of the encounter with new and unusual alien beings with relative calm.\n\nThe supposed vacuum habitat of the aliens sparked some short-lived controversy in certain circles of the scientific community on [Root.Capital.GetName], but the previous discovery of lower forms of life had largely prepared all [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] for the shock."

 story.3.desc.spiri:1 "The priesthoods on [Root.Capital.GetName] had a generally favorable reaction to the reports of complex - yet dumb - organisms found on alien planets.\n\nThe findings did spark some inter-doctrinal debate - is this proof that the [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are the lords of all within creation, or have we simply not yet encountered our brethren from beyond the void?"
 story.3.desc.followup:0 "Following previous reports on alien life, [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] xeno-biologists are pleased to learn to complex life forms that appear not too different from what we would find on [Root.Capital.GetName].\n\nThe beings still defy easy classification and hardly possess anything more than purely animal instincts, but their existence does indicate that some patterns of life are indeed universal."
